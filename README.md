<p>I have experienced few things in life that all at once can bring out the incredible amount of passion and satisfaction I get from coding ... then immediately make me want to faceplant into the nearest wall. 

I have too many examples to count having run into situations, hours on end, where I spent incredible amounts of time debugging an error or trying to force a block of code to do exactly what I want. 

What continues to amaze me though is that no matter how long it takes, no matter how frustrated I become, as soon as I insert that missing piece into the puzzle ... "Houston, we have lift off üöÄ ." I am on cloud 9 ‚òÅÔ∏è

It's in this continuous fight for humanity I find one of my true passions in life ... Writing code üíª!

I am currently focused on developing mobile applications in React Native, working as a Full Stack engineer responsible for building out frontend UI, backend API endpoints, and a lot more. 

Wrapping up my B.A in Cyber Security I plan to start my Master's in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance around the end of this year. (I also find passion in breaking into things, legally of course üëÄ). 

Always looking to connect with tech enthusiasts and those who share in the neverending struggle of writing perfect code ü§ì</p>
